# Python Journey

A structured learning path focused on mastering Python fundamentals and advanced concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Phase_1_BASICS** - 21 units covering fundamental Python concepts
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED** - 33 units covering OOP, type hints, decorators, algorithms, and more
- **Structured unit templates** for consistent learning experience

## How Each Unit Works

Every unit contains 4 files in a structured learning sequence:

### File Structure

```
unit_name/
├── concept.md       # Theory and explanations
├── drill.py         # Syntax practice exercises
├── task.md          # Exercise questions (defines steps)
└── answer.py        # Your implementation workspace
```

### Purpose of Each File

**concept.md** - Learning material
- Contains explanations, syntax rules, code examples, and theory

**drill.py** - Syntax practice
- Several quick repetition of new syntax patterns to build muscle memory
- Time: 5-10 minutes

**task.md** - Exercise definition (created before answer.py)
- You first create this file to define the exercise
- Break down the exercise into several steps
- Specifies expected output for verification

**answer.py** - Implementation workspace (supports task.md)
- A supporting file that mirrors the step structure from task.md
- You write code here to complete task by completing each step defined in task.md

### Learning Flow

1. Read `concept.md` to understand the concepts
2. Complete `drill.py` exercises for syntax familiarity
3. Read `task.md` to understand what to build and how it's broken into steps
4. Implement solutions in `answer.py`, completing each step in sequence

The key distinction: `drill.py` builds syntax muscle memory through repetition, while `task.md` + `answer.py` build problem-solving skills through structured exercises.

## Quick Start

1. Start with **Phase_1_BASICS** if you're new to Python
2. Progress to **Phase_2_ADVANCED** after completing the basics
3. Follow each unit sequentially (see learning flow below)

---

## Current Status

- **Phase_1_BASICS:** Python Fundamentals - ✓ Completed (21/21 units)
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED:** Advanced Python - In Progress (2/33 units)

---

## Time Estimates

**Per Phase:**
- **Phase_1_BASICS:** 21 units × 30 min = ~10.5 hours (1-3 weeks)
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED:** 33 units × 30 min = ~16.5 hours (2-4 weeks)

**Learning pace:**
- Full-time (8 units/day): Complete both in ~1.5 weeks
- Part-time (4 units/day): Complete both in ~3 weeks
- Casual (2 units/day): Complete both in ~6 weeks
