# Python Journey

A structured learning path focused on mastering Python fundamentals and advanced concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Phase_1_BASICS** - 21 units covering fundamental Python concepts
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED** - 32 units covering OOP, type hints, decorators, algorithms, and more
- **Capstone Project** - Comprehensive final project integrating all skills
- **Structured unit templates** for consistent learning experience

## How Each Unit Works

Every unit contains 4 files in a structured learning sequence:

### File Structure

```
unit_name/
├── concept.md       # Theory and explanations
├── drill.py         # Syntax practice exercises
├── task.md          # Exercise questions (defines steps)
└── answer.py        # Your implementation workspace
```

### Purpose of Each File

**concept.md** - Learning material
- Contains explanations, syntax rules, code examples, and theory

**drill.py** - Syntax practice
- Several quick repetition of new syntax patterns to build muscle memory
- Time: 5-10 minutes

**task.md** - created before answer.py
- One massive structured exercise allow user to practice multiple skills learned in current unit and craft problem solving skills

**answer.py** - Implementation workspace (supports task.md)

### Learning Flow

1. Read `concept.md` to understand the concepts
2. Complete `drill.py` exercises for syntax familiarity
3. Read `task.md` to understand what to build and how it's broken into steps
4. Implement solutions in `answer.py`, completing each step in sequence

## Current Status

- **Phase_1_BASICS:** Python Fundamentals - ✓ Completed (21/21 units)
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED:** Advanced Python - In Progress (2/32 units)
- **Capstone:** Not started

---

## Time Estimates

**Per Phase:**
- **Phase_1_BASICS:** 21 units × 30 min = ~10.5 hours (1-3 weeks)
- **Phase_2_ADVANCED:** 32 units × 30 min = ~16 hours (2-4 weeks)
- **Capstone:** ~10-20 hours depending on features implemented

**Learning pace:**
- Full-time (8 units/day): Complete both phases in ~1.5 weeks
- Part-time (4 units/day): Complete both phases in ~3 weeks
- Casual (2 units/day): Complete both phases in ~6 weeks

## Capstone Project

After completing both phases, build a **Task Management CLI Application** that integrates everything you've learned:

**What you'll build:**
- Complete command-line task manager with CRUD operations
- Task priorities, categories, and search functionality
- Data persistence using JSON files
- Custom exceptions and error handling
- Decorators for logging and validation
- Full OOP design with type hints throughout

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Phase 1: File I/O, dictionaries, lists, control flow, error handling
- Phase 2: OOP, type hints, decorators, context managers, custom exceptions

See [`capstone/task.md`](file:///Users/ianchen/development/python_projects/python-journey/capstone/task.md) for detailed requirements.
