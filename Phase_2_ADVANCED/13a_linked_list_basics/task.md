# Task Description

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Step 1: Create a Node Class
Create a `Node` class that:
- Has `data` attribute to store the value
- Has `next` attribute pointing to the next node (defaults to None)

## Step 2: Create a LinkedList Class
Create a `LinkedList` class that:
- Has a `head` attribute (initially None)
- Has `append(data)` method to add nodes to the end
- Has `display()` method to print all values

## Step 3: Implement Size Tracking
Add a `size` attribute and `get_size()` method to track list length.

## Step 4: Test Your Linked List
Create a linked list, add several elements, display them, and show the size.

**Expected Output:**
When you run the code, the terminal should show:
```text
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> None
Size: 4

Adding more elements...
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> None
Size: 6
```
