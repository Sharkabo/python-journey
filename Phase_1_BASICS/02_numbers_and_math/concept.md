# Unit 02: Numbers & Math

## 1. Numbers (Integers and Floats)
Unlike text (Strings), numbers don't need quotes.

**Syntax:**
```python
age = 25       # Integer (whole numbers)
height = 1.75  # Float (decimal numbers)
name = "Ian"   # String (needs quotes)
```

**Example:**
```python
x = 10
y = 3.14
total = x + y
print(total)  # Prints: 13.14
```

## 2. Basic Math Operations
You can do math with numbers just like on a calculator.

**Syntax:**
```python
+  # Addition
-  # Subtraction
*  # Multiplication
/  # Division
```

**Example:**
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x * y
print(result)  # Prints: 50
```

## Spiral Learning Note
In Unit 01, we printed text. Now we calculate numbers. In the next unit, we will combine these to ask the user for numbers and calculate them!
