# Unit 01: Print & Variables

## 1. Print
The most basic function of a program is "talk" to you. In Python, we use the `print()` command to display text on the screen.

**Syntax:**
```python
print("Put your text here")
```

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello World")
print("I am learning Python")
```

## 2. Variables
Imagine a variable is a **Label Sticker** that you put on a box containing data. This allows us to refer to the data by its "Label Name" later.

**Syntax:**
```python
variable_name = "Content"
```

**Example:**
```python
my_hero = "Iron Man"
print(my_hero)  # Prints: Iron Man
```

## Spiral Learning Note
In this unit, we only learned how to store "Text" (Strings) in variables. Next time, we will learn how to store "Numbers" and do basic math with them.
