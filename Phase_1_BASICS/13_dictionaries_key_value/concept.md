# Unit 13: Dictionaries (Key-Value)

## 1. What is a Dictionary?
Lists use numbers (indexes) to find things. **Dictionaries** use words (Keys) to find things (Values).

**Syntax:**
```python
dictionary = {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
# Access values using keys
value = dictionary["key1"]
```

**Example:**
```python
person = {
    "name": "Ian",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

print(person["name"])  # Prints: Ian
print(person["age"])   # Prints: 30
```

We are upgrading our storage! Variables (Unit 01) hold one thing. Lists (Unit 05) hold a list of things. Dictionaries hold structured data describing one complex thing.
